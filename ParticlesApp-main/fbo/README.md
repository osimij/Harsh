## 🛠️ Technical Overview  
This Three.js scene uses an advanced **GPU particle simulation** approach, powered by **vertex and fragment shaders**, including:  

📌 **Vertex Shader:** Defines how particles move dynamically in real-time  
📌 **Fragment Shader:** Controls color blending and realistic shading effects  
📌 **Simulation Shaders:** Custom GLSL scripts for physics-based interactions  
📌 **React Three Fiber Integration:** Optimized for modern React applications  

Unlike basic Three.js particle systems, this setup runs entirely on the **GPU**, making it incredibly efficient even for **massive particle counts**.
